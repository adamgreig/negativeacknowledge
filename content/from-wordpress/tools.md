I find it can be useful to look over other people's tool kits and see
what neat things you may be missing out on - I've certainly found out
about a few things this way!

The main tools I currently use, in order of use, are:

1.  Soldering iron: I use an "[AUTO-TEMP SOLDERING STATION 369][]", but
    anything with temperature control shoud do you. I use it with 0.8mm
    tips.
2.  Solder: I use a combination of 0.8mm leaded, 0.8mm lead-free and
    1.2mm lead-free. The thinner stuff is great for surface mount work,
    the thicker stuff works nicely for everything else and tinning the
    tip.
3.  Wire cutters/strippers: I use a great automatic wire stripping thing
    which cuts and pulls the insulation off pretty much any thickness in
    one squeeze. You can get them from Rapid [here][].
4.  Tweezers, Snips: I have a 6-pack of these with needle nosed, normal
    and bent tweezers and two types of flat snips. They're pretty
    useful!
5.  Multimeter: There are loads of these and I won't bore you with the
    details, but they're an essential if you're going to be doing much
    work.
6.  Helping Hands / 3rd Hands: These things are so useful for any PCB
    wor, soldering wires together, all of that. Mine have a magnifying
    glass on them and I got two in case I need four hands.
7.  Solder wick / solder sucker: These both remove excess solder. Great
    for accidental bridges.
8.  Flux: I have a flux pen that I use to cover PCB pads before
    soldering, and a flux syringe ful of gel that I use for surface
    mounted chips since it holds them in place at the same time. Both
    are really, really useful for soldering.
9.  Loupe. Mine has a white LED at the end and offers 10x magnification,
    I got it from Farnell [here][1]. It's ideal for surface mounted
    work, really helps check that things are correctly soldered.
10. Hot glue gun. You can pick these up anywhere and they're great for
    fixing things in place and even potting projects if they're in
    cases. Try not to get a cheap one that'l drip things everywhere.

For some other people's Tools lists, check out [LadyAda's page][], and
the Evil Mad Scientists have a great page [here][2] about 5 neat tools.

Am I missing anything? Feel free to let me know in the comments.
