Hey everyone,

I'll be documenting various electronics projects here, of a wide range
of subjects. If this is your kind of thing, feel free to subscribe to
the RSS or come check back in a bit, I'll be writing up projects as I do
them from now on, and will probably write up some of the more fun older
projects.

You can check out my Flickr photos on electronics [here][], to get an
idea of the kind of things I've been playing with.

Thanks for dropping by!

Adam
