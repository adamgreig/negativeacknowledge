So, I'm part of a team entering the UK Space Experiment Competition, and
basically our proposal won out and is now one of six final proposals
around the country! This is great stuff but we wanted to put on a
display at a stand at a fair someplace, and for this we need something
tangible!

The actual proposal calls for a piece of light detecting kit that runs
some **£1500** and we certainly can't afford that, so instead I'm using
a £0.50 light dependant resistor: pretty crude but works great!

What's happening is the LEDs are being lit up, the Arduino reads the
light level coming off the LDR and shows it on the LCD. When you put
your hand or a piece of paper over the LEDs, the light reflects down
onto the LDR, increasing the light level! In space, the bits of dust act
as the paper and you can detect a whole lot less light.

The next step is vacuum forming a little case for the thing!
