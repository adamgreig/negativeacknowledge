I'm off to Mongolia for a month in only five days, and one of the toys
I'll be bringing is a Nerf Vertex, basically you throw it and it
whistles as it moves and you can catch it and all that fun stuff.

It does have one problem out of the box, though - you can't see it at
night! A few small coin cell batteries and an LED soon fixed that
problem, though:
