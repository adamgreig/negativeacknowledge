The twelve nixie tubes (and corresponding driver ICs) I ordered two
weeks ago arrived today from http://tubes-store.com in Russia. They were
beautifully packaged in two layers of foam and a cardboard box from some
kind of kid's milk in Russia. All the tubes are intact and in great
condition considering they were made in mid 1980! The outer envelope
even had my name written in Cyrillic as well as Latin, which is a neat
touch. At any rate, all I need to do now is figure out how to generate
170V DC and I can power these things up! At some point I plan to make a
clock with date/time. (how innovative, I know!)
