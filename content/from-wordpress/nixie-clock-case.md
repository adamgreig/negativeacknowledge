Hurrah! The laser cut acrylic for my [NIXIE tube clock case][]arrived
this morning, and amazingly all the parts fit together nicely. The screw
holes even matched up with the PCBs!

I'm pretty happy with how this turned out, and I can finally say the
nixie clock project is finished. I definitely learned a lot for the next
clock - like use the RTC with an onboard crystal! I'm thinking of
perhaps making a wordclock.

You can check out the Inkscape files I sent to Ponoko for manufacture
[here][] (they are released under CC BY-SA 3.0 if you are interested).

In unrelated news, design on revision four of my motor controller is
nearing completion, so hopefully the thing will be flying soon!
