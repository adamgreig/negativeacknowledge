Slug: suppliers

First, a caveat: this page is mainly going to focused on UK suppliers,
so if you're in the US you'd be better off checking out a page like
[this][] [ladyada.net].

With that out the way, here are the suppliers I've used in the UK:

-   [Rapid Electronics][]: These guys are my favourite for most
    electronics parts, if they have them on the catalogue. Shipping is
    cheap and prompt, parts come in excellent little packages and mostly
    everything is pretty cheap. However, they don't carry a particularly
    huge range of 'fun' parts.
-   [Maplin][]: I used to use them a lot, however they seem to keep
    removing things from their Electronics section (rather like Radio
    Shack in the US, from what I hear), and the prices aren't too great.
    Shipping is prompt, but I prefer Rapid.
-   [Farnell][]: While they don't accept PayPal, they do stock just
    about everything and shipping is great. Prices are good and you can
    get some nice bulk discounts.
-   [SparkFun][]: These guys are American, so shipping costs, but I
    don't tend to get hit with import duty from their packages. They
    sell a huge range of fun components, including OLED screens, GSM
    modules, GPS modules, you name it. Great for specialty items, but
    they don't have a wide range of other things you'll need.

In general, I've been able to find everything I've wanted from some
combination of these suppliers.

If you know of any other good places you think I should add, feel free
to leave a comment.
