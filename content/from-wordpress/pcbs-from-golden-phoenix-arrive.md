I guess my new project has officially started! The PCBs I ordered from
Golden Phoenix arrived today, a day short of two weeks from when I
placed the order.

They've turned out really nicely, and I especially like the black
soldermask. I plan to reflow solder the components on these using the
grill in the oven - I don't see why it shouldn't work, but it may be
difficult getting the right temperature. Who knows? I've got solder
paste at the ready, at any rate.
