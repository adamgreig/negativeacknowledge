I'm having a play with robotics stuff now, and one of the first steps
was to get something moving.

I ordered some cheapo servos from [ServoShop UK][] and had a play, they
work fine.

However, to use them as easy-to-drive motors for wheels and stuff, you
need to modify them to have unlimited rotation (they normally only have
180 degrees). This means they can no longer go to an exact position, but
can be driven in different directions and their speed controlled, all
through timed pulses - so much easier than wiring a motor, gearbox, H
bridge and then controlling all that! (and cheaper, too).

[Society of Robots][] has a load of great tutorials, and [one of them][]
details modifying servos to get continuous rotation. I followed the
tutorial through for the HS-311 servos I had, and it works nicely.

I also photographed each step of the way to make a mini-guide on
modifying this specific servo, hopefully this will help out someone with
these (fairly common) servos.
