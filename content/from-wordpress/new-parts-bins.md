At the same time I got my new brush/scourer, I also got four 16-tray
storage containers which were some Â£2/ea and looked ideal for holding
all my parts, which had grown out of hand in the previous containers.

I quickly loaded them up and just got around to printing out some labels
on cardstock and sorting them!
